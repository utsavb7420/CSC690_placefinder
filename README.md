 Utsav Bhatta:  I created second page where users can see locations which are related to the selected type in previous screen. User can be able to select one from those items,  then he will be directed to the map  screen with marked directions to the location from the current location.

When developing this, I have used tableView, GooglePlaces API, Alamofire Network Client, SwiftyJSON.

To run this project we need to install cocoapods. Pushing pods to the github failed due to large file sizes.
Thank you.
