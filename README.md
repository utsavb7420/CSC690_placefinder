Three of us created a map application "PlaceFinder." It is an app where users can search places by category. The users GPS location is used to find the near by locations and google map is used for routing and show the google rating of that destination. 

# Mohammedrehan: I created storyboard and home page for the app. The home page allows user to search places by categories. When developing this, I have used StackViews, Buttons, ImageViews.

 Utsav Bhatta:  I created second page where users can see locations which are related to the selected type in previous screen. User can be able to select one from those items,  then he will be directed to the map  screen with marked directions to the location from the current location.

When developing this, I have used tableView, GooglePlaces API, Alamofire Network Client, SwiftyJSON.

To run this project we need to install cocoapods. Pushing pods to the github failed due to large file sizes.
Thank you.
